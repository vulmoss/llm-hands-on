# Changelog

All notable changes to `claude-red` are documented here. The library follows a phased roadmap (see [README.md](README.md#roadmap)). Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) where breaking changes mean skill renames, removals, or category restructures.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Added ChatGPT and Codex exports for all 79 source skills, a Chinese ChatGPT prompt, and repository guidance in AGENTS.md.
- Replaced the legacy converter with dependency-free handling of YAML and Markdown metadata; full methodology headings and examples are preserved in generated references.
- Changed installation defaults to project-local Codex skills; added selective export, dry-run, conflict protection, and regression checks.
- Added skills.json with complete metadata for both source formats; retained claude-skills.json as the upstream snapshot.
- Replaced an inactive EXIF viewer reference in `offensive-osint` with a browser-local metadata viewer and added evidence-corroboration guidance.

### Planned

- Phase 1 — Internal AD/Windows split (16 skills)
- Phase 2 — Cloud Identity / Hybrid (10 skills)
- Phase 4 — IoT split (10 skills)
- Phase 5 — Web Basics (8 skills)
- Phase 6 — Web Advanced (10 skills)
